## Intro

[This assignment](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/assessment2/index.html) required that we develop a model, application, or analysis from scratch... In particular, the project had to:
- Read in some data.
- Process it in some way.
- Display the results.
- Write the results to a file.

For this project, my hope is that we will read in the [Paid Price Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads) from HM Land Registry, write it to a [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) database, and create a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web app that uses Leaflet to visualize a selection of that data on a map. This should be able to run anywhere by anyone with the code, but we'll host it on PythonAnywhere; and then we'll try and also have an API on the PythonAnywhere site so that we can also display the Leaflet frontend on a static site.

## Discussion

Why are House Prices important? We could talk about the *Housing Crisis* and affordable housing...

## Documentation

This ~~will be~~ is automatically generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html), which I learnt to use for [the previous project](https://github.com/peterprescott/agent-based-modelling). For this to work we have to make sure we write proper docstrings. We use [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods), which means we require [the Napoleon extension](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for Sphinx.

Having generated it with Sphinx, we can also host the documentation freely at [ReadTheDocs.org](https://readthedocs.org).

## UML Diagram

[StackOverflow suggests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/260165/whats-the-best-way-to-generate-a-uml-diagram-from-python-source-code) that UML diagrams could be automated.

## Tests

*Test-Driven Development* [@Percival2017] requires that before actually doing anything, we run a test that will check whether what we want to do is done. We run the test before writing the desired feature, so that it fails (obviously), then we write the feature, and then the test should run successfully.
